# Peer-to-Peer-Synchronized
#This is a software project that makes a peer to peer communication between different machines to distribute the working load on them
#To run this project all what you have to do is to install any Java IDE and run this project on multiple consoles if you don't have more than one machine.
#Or connect the different machines with a lan or the same router and run the program on them.
